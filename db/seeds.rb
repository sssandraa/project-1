########### different ways to write your seeds ############

# # 2. Mass create -- in order to connect them later IN SEEDS (not through the app) you'll need to find their id
# ## a. by passing an array of hashes:
# Plant.create([
#     {name: "Corn Tree", bought: 20170203, color: "green"},
#     {name: "Prayer plant", bought: 20190815, color: "purple"},
#     {name: "Cactus", bought: 20200110, color: "ugly green"}
# ])
# ## b. by interating over an array of hashes:
# plants = [{name: "Elephant bush", bought: 20180908, color: "green"},
#     {name: "Photos", bought: 20170910, color: "green"},
#     {name: "Dragon tree", bought: 20170910, color: "green"},
#     {name: "Snake plant", bought: 20170910, color: "dark green"},
#     {name: "polka dot plant", bought: 20170915, color: "pink and green"},
#     {name: "Cactus", bought: 20200517, color: "green"}]

# plants.each{|hash| Plant.create(hash)}

# # 3. Use Faker and mass create
# ## step 1: write a method that creates a person
# def create_person
#     free = ["mornings", "evenings", "always", "afternoons", "weekends", "none"].sample

#     person = Person.create(
#         name: Faker::Movies::HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy.character,
#         free_time: free,
#         age: rand(11...70)
#     )
# end

# ## step 2: write a method that creates a joiner
# def create_joiners(person)
#     plants_number = rand(1..4)
#     plants_number.times do 
#         PlantParenthood.create(
#             plant_id: Plant.all.sample.id, 
#             person_id: person.id, 
#             affection: rand(101), 
#             favorite?: [true, false].sample
#         )
#     end
# end

# ## step 3: invoke creating joiners by passing in an instance of a person
# 10.times do     
#     create_joiners(create_person)
#     ##### ALTERNATIVE:
#     # person = create_person
#     # create_joiners(person)
# end

# indoor = Category.create(name: "indoors")

# Plant.update(category_id: indoor.id)
